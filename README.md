Humans, by themselves, are rather boring creatures. Compared to other animals, we don’t run fast, we don’t swim very well, and aren’t (naturally) killing machines . Our strengths lie in our intelligence, and things we create. We solved our boredom by creating sources of fun, and one of our greatest achievements is the world wide web, and video games. Video games has been a staple of human entertainment for many decades, and a favorite past time for millions of people. A large percentage of the internet is dedicated to video games, and entire communities are created to support people’s hobbies. These communities are gateways to meeting new people, whom you know share the same interests as you. As more time is being spent on the internet, some people find it easier to live behind a blue screen rather than real life. But are there consequences to the time we put into what we enjoy? We believe we can answer this question by looking at the correlations between video game playtime and depressive factors through our tools in R. There are many studies coming out that try to find the possible seriousness of overexposure to online life, and the results tend to vary. There a studies that have shown the benefits of video games, such as the increase in neural reaction time and hand eyecoordination(https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00031/full). However, this study was done with specific games that targeted specific functions, based on an age range, and limited the amount of play time. On the other hand, there are also many studies that have shown the possible increase of social anxiety due to online exposure, as online life has the possibility to create insecurities about oneself. 
We believe that if we can find signals in our data set that shows increased video game exposure leads to a change in social anxiety features, it can help us identify whether video games are harmful or not.

•	However, this is targeted towards adolescents who are much more susceptible to influence, where it matters for their growth. As adults, it’s much harder to say what is beneficial and what’s not, as there is many variables to measure in order to find an answer that can be true for the entire population. 

•	We hope to use a similar method except on adults to answer our question.

•	This study looks at symptoms of depression and anxiety and whether playing video games can increase them or decrease them, so similar to what we hope to do it shows an impact of video games and mental health. 

•	However we hope to take data to see how video games effect normal people, and we also want to look at more issues than just depression and anxiety.

•	This study is similar in that it interacts with data between video games and some factor. The method and the people we polled are very similar 

•	However this factor is different than what we hope to analyze, this data source looks at how video game players react to covid 19 concern. Which isn’t something that we are analyzing.

•	This study is similar to the previous in that it is analyzing the effects of video games on something using a data set. 

•	However it is different from what we hope to do in that it only touches on children and how it effects cognitive abilities which isn’t something we purely hope to measure.

(Data)
This data was collected using various internet forums including reddit and teamliquid.net, it aims to find how people act based on the amount and type of video game they played. The columns include video game type (from a variety of specific ones identified in the study) and the rows contain various factors that indicate emotional well-being and other correlative factors. 
 Should we be worried about the hours we spend online, and should we try to change it? Do hours spent on videogames and online life have an effect on life satisfaction and overall mental health? We want to investigate this and see if there is a correlation. We think this is worth investigating because, for many young people, a quarter of people’s lives are spent online in some way. Although there are some benefits, such as the spread of knowledge, creating a disconnection between virtual life and real life can create a disparity between what’s real and what’s not. Answering this question is also important for us to understand the tradeoffs that video games have to offer, whether it’s worth it to play or not. Or if there’s a critical point in the amount of time we play so that we can maximize the benefits and decrease the harms. It’s easy to believe what you see online as truth, and some things can have a negative impact on self-image and mental stability.
